# The MDL Programming Language

This repository contains a Markdown representation of *The MDL Programming Language* by S. W. Galley and Greg Pfister, originally written with support from the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense (DARPA).

## Development disclaimer

This a personal project in its early stages of development and planning. It is not ready for collaboration or a guarantee of fitness. It's being made available for transparency (and so I have something to point to when I want to talk about it), but be warned that:

- Support requests via GitHub issues or email will go unanswered and ignored
- Pull requests will be summarily rejected
- Public progress may be minimal to non-existent for long stretches at a time

You're welcome to use what's here under the terms of its license (if one is available) or the principles of fair use (if one is not). If you like the idea/premise behind this project, I would suggest starting over the way you'd want to do it yourself as I am very unlikely to accept future contributions forked off of, or derived from, this project's current stage of development.

# Appendix 3. Predefined Types 

On these two pages is a table showing each of MDL's predefined `TYPE`s, its primitive type if 
different, and various flags: `S` for `STRUCTURED`, `E` for `EVALTYPE` not `QUOTE`, and `A` for `APPLICABLE`. 

`X` means that an object of that `TYPE` cannot be `CHTYPE`d to and hence cannot be `READ` in (if 
attempted, a `CAN'T-CHTYPE-INTO` error is usual). 

`B` means that an object of that `TYPE` cannot be `READ` in (if attempted, a `STORAGE-TYPES-DIFFER` 
error is usual), that instead it is built by the interpreter or `CHTYPE`d to by a program, and that its 
`PRINT`ed representation makes it look as though its `TYPEPRIM` were different. 

`%` means that an object of that `TYPE` is `PRINT`ed using `%` notation and can be `READ` in only that way.
